# Ludum Dare 44	

A short space management game made in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 44. You can download the game on [itch.io](https://meursault.itch.io/space-struggle) and rate it on [ldjam.com](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/space-struggle).

The game is developed with the MonoGame framework and is built on top of my always in progress library (providing Input, Sprite, Scene, and other fun classes). This library is not publicly available but you find a zip of it in this project. When looking at the code, keep in mind that this game was developed in 48 hours and things had to get done quickly.

## Premise

Space Struggle is a space management game. You are the captain of a rebel ship that fights the Dog Catcher Association (DCA) to protect the dog population of your solar system.

Today you attacked a DCA outpost and freed seven cute puppies. Several DCA ships are hunting you as a result. They hacked your bank account and you are not able to access your money. You must reach your Home planet. They can defend you from the DCA.

Your fuel is limited and you will have to trade parts of your ship for fuel to reach Home. Selling parts will make you slower and weaker. Selling too much of the wrong parts can mean death. Your ship has four types of parts: Scanning, Speed, Damage, and Defense parts. Check the ingame help screen for more explanations.

Letâ€™s hope you can make it Home. FOR THE DOGGOS!
