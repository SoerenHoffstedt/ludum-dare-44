Countering will let the opponent attack first, giving you the chance for a strong counter attack (+2 damage). The damage given is your Attack minus the enemies Defense. The base chance of fleeing is 25%. Each speed point increases your chance of fleeing by 10% chance. Winning a battle rewards you fuel.</string>
